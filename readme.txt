    1. In a word/text document describe the theme for your game. What is the genre for the game that you will be using (outer space adventure, cave adventure, other)?1/
    
    I went with the somewhat abstract theme "Give me an A in this course!". The player sprite (currently the letter I) will be a little picture of my head, and the player is tasked with collected 100 % points at which point the game ends. The enemy sprite is the letter B, and if the player touches the B mob, they recieve a B for the course and thus fail the game!
    
    2. In the text document describe what images you will be using. Will you be using your own that you create or will you be using ones you find from other sites? You can place a few images in the word document as an example for me to see. 
    
    I am planning on using css as much as possible to achieve my graphics. Originally I wanted to just use the image of my head as the player sprite, but correctly formatting the font characters that make up the other parts of the game is a little sloppy. I will be replacing the % and B symbols with transparent .gif versions of the same font characters. I am currently undecided on the game grid, I may try to replicate the look of Canvas' calandar feature.
    
    3. In the text document describe which aspects of ES6 you will be incorporating into the game. 
    
    I am already using const, and haven't taken the time to go through and change all my var into let. I also want to use the enhanced object literals, and the "fat arrow" function shortcut. I watched a bunch of Youtube videos about ecmascript 6 over the weekend and I'm very excited to start incorporating more features!
    
    4. In the text document describe how you may use jQuery with the game. You can also use Greensock animation tools if you'd like. The animation can be part of the interface or the start screen. 
    
    I am already using jQuery to manipulate DOM elements and their contents. I've already added GSAP links, but have not utilized it yet. I would very much like to add some "juice" to make the final product look better. At minimum I want to have animation for movement of sprites.
